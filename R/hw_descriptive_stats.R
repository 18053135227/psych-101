## The following measurements of weight (in grams) have been recorded for a
## common strain of 70 31-day-old rats.

rat_weights <- c(120, 116, 94, 120, 112, 112, 106, 102, 118, 112, 116, 98, 116,
                 114, 120, 124, 112, 122, 110, 84, 106, 122, 124, 112, 118, 128,
                 108, 120, 110, 106, 106, 102, 140, 102, 122, 112, 110, 130,
                 112, 114, 108, 110, 116, 118, 118, 108, 102, 110, 104, 112,
                 122, 112, 116, 110, 112, 118, 98, 104, 120, 106, 108, 110, 102,
                 110, 120, 126, 114, 98, 116, 100)


## (a) Plot a relative frequency histogram of these data using bin size = 5

## (b) Plot a relative frequency histogram of these data using bin size = 2

## (c) Add mean and sd indicators to the histogram


## NOTE: 2
## In a genetic study, a regular food was placed in each of 20 vials and the
## number of flies of a particular genotype feeding on each vialwas recorded.
## The counts of the flies were also recorded for another set of 20 vials that
## contained grape juice. The following data sets were obtained:

n_flies_regular_food <- c(15, 20, 31, 16, 22, 22, 23, 33, 38, 28, 25, 20, 21,
                          23, 29, 26, 40, 20, 19, 31)

n_flies_grape_juice <- c(6, 19, 0, 2, 11, 12, 13, 12, 5, 16, 2, 7, 13, 20, 18,
                         19, 19, 9, 9, 9)

## (a) Plot seperate dot plots for the two data sets

## (b) Make a visual comparison of the two distributions with respect to their
## relative locations and spreads. To do this, plot a vertical line at the mean
## value of each distribution on top of each dot plot, and a horizontal line
## centered at the mean value and extending 1 standard deviation in either
## direction.

## (c) Plot each distribution as a relative frequency historgam. Overlay a
## smooth curve estimate of the density. Plot both distributions in the same
## panel. Add mean and sd indicators to the plot.

## (d) Do you think the flies like one food more than the other? Which food
## would you bet they liked more? How confident are you in your guess? Why?


## NOTE: 3
## (a) load the built in data set "trees" into a data.table

## (b) plot a separate relative frequency histogram for "Girth", "height",
## "Volume". For each, overlay a smooth curve estimate of the density, and
## indicate mean values via vertical lines.

## (c) Suppose that in a bet, you are required to place a bet on the numerical
## value of one of "Girth", "height", "Volume". Which would you choose to bet
## on, and what numerical value would you bet on?

## NOTE: 4
## ChickWeight
## The body weights of the chicks were measured at birth and every second day
## thereafter until day 20. They were also measured on day 21. There were four
## groups on chicks on different protein diets.

## weight:
## a numeric vector giving the body weight of the chick (gm).

## Time:
## a numeric vector giving the number of days since birth when the measurement
## was made.

## Chick:
## an ordered factor with levels 18 < â€¦ < 48 giving a unique identifier for the
## chick. The ordering of the levels groups chicks on the same diet together and
## orders them according to their final weight (lightest to heaviest) within
## diet.

## Diet:
## a factor with levels 1 thru 4 indicating which experimental diet the chick
## received.
d <- as.data.table(ChickWeight)

## (a) begin by plotting x=time y=weight for all rats separately and grouped by diet

## (b) plot mean of all rats per groupd

## (c) add error bars

## (d) Lets inspect the distribution of final weights
## plot histogram of final weights seperately for each group

## (e) Inspect the distribution of final weights using a box plot

## (f) Inspect the final weights using a bar graph with error bars

## (g)
## Which feed would you choose?
## How confident are you in your choice?
## Would your decision be different at day 10 than at day 20?

## Try to frame your answer in terms of likelihood, probability and the plots we
## just made


## (h):
## What do you think the distribution of weights would look like at
## day 30?

## We will eventually get to formal methods for doing this, but for now just use
## intuition and critical thinking to take a stab at this question
