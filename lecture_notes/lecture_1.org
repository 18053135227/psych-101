* hello
- I'm a person
- who am I and why am I teaching this class (hint: it's not for the money)
- check out my linkedin / website
- please ask lots of questions
* please tell me you own a good computer
* wtf is my text editor?
- you guys will probably use R Studio
- if looking at my program is a pain, I'll try to switch... maybe
* syllabus
- we don't have offices
- 2.5 hours of lecture is probably a bit much
- lecture outlines, but everything will be subject to improv
- this is as much, if not more, a class about R than statistics
-- my primary goal is for you to be genuinely more useful human beings
-- basically everybody I've asked has said that they didn't feel they learned
   statistics until they learned R (or whatever other program they used) to --
   DO -- statistics
-- contrast this with the theory-centric approach I took in 2012 (see website)

* what is the final project?
- real data
- R code report with lots of numbers, pictures, and decisions
* do you have to code just like me?
- nope.
- if you are experienced and have your own style... go for it
* what is statistics? 
- describe data in numbers and pictures (descriptive statistics)
- make evidence-based decisions (inferential statistics)

* lecture outlines
- again, everything subject to massive amounts of improv
- all I can really promise is that you will see and use R A LOT

* Lets get to it
- R demos and prep for HW 1
- I'm guessing that my R code might be a bit too advanced for first timers
-- If it is, SORRY. I will adapt.
-- It's your job to slow me down until we converge on an agreeable style
-- We have awesome and experienced GSIs... they will help
* WTF: difference between = and <-???
