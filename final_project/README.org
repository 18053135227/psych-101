* grading the final prject
- the point of the final project is to apply everything we have covered in
  lecture and in homeworks to a real-world scenario.

** everything we will cover is:
-- R, data.table, and ggplot
-- descriptive statistics
-- probability and random variables
-- inferential statistics

- The framing of the project will be to write the results section of a paper 
  for which the introduction and methods will be provided.

- use R, data.table, and ggplot
-- load data into a data.table
-- summarize data with ggplot figures

- descriptive statistics
-- make sure the figures indicate relevant descriptive statistics
--- markers to indicate central tendency and data spread (e.g., error bars)
-- make lots of different types of figures
--- x/y scatter plots
--- box plots
--- bar plots
--- histograms
--- etc.

- use inferential statistics to assess the significance of the effects
  illustrated by your ggplot figures
-- t-tests
-- ANOVA
-- Chi-squared
-- etc.
