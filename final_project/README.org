* grading the final prject
- the point of the final project is to apply everything we have covered in
  lecture and in homeworks to a real-world scenario.
  
** The framing of the project 
- Write the results section of a paper for which the introduction and methods 
  will be provided.

** everything we will cover is:
- R, data.table, and ggplot
- descriptive statistics
- probability and random variables
- inferential statistics

*** use R, data.table, and ggplot
- load data into a data.table
- summarize data with ggplot figures

*** descriptive statistics
- make sure the figures indicate relevant descriptive statistics
-- markers to indicate central tendency and data spread (e.g., error bars)
- make lots of different types of figures
-- x/y scatter plots
-- box plots
-- bar plots
-- histograms
-- etc.

*** use inferential statistics 
- assess the significance of the effects revealed in your figures
- t-tests
- ANOVA
- Chi-squared
- etc.
